Xavier Quinn

I affirm that I have carried out the attached academic endeavors
with full academic honesty, in accordance with the Union College
Honor Code and the course syllabus.

	a) 5 and 11

	b) It should be at index 45 because you find the left child at 2*current_index and the right child at 2*current_index+1

	c) The height should be 8

	d) 7,8,5,10,12,4,3,13

	e) 11,5,8,9,7,6

	f) 13,3,1,2,1,3,4,12,10,5,8,7,6,7,8,9,8,5,10,11,10,12,4,3,13,14,18,14,13 (if you recount passing through nodes in the returns)

	g) I'm not really sure what this question is asking, but if I understand it correctly: left children then right children.
