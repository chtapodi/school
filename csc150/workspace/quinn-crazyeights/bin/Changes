Card:

Made a second constructor and changed all the variables to private
I changed some variable names to have proper camelCase

Deck:

Moved the random constructor into the shuffle method as it wasnt neccisary elsewhere.
I had an annoying amount of magic numbers, which I have fixed. In doing this I have fixed the way the itterators work so they will work with larger deck sizes
I also fixed the naming convention and changed suites 

Hand to change what is returned because I only worried about suites in the last itteration.
