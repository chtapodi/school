	At 'myBoard = new DrawingBox();' The constructor is invoked
	In the documentation it gives two options, one being no arguments, which uses the default title, 
	and the other using a string as an argument, which specifies the title of the board.
	
	It represents a method in the DrawingBox class, and the first one is used because 
	it accepted 4 ints instead of one object.
	The args represent the x and y coordinates and the width and the height of the rectangle.
